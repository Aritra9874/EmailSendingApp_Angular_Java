<h1>EmailSendingApplication</h1>
<h3>About:</h3>
It is a basic email sending application based on Angular and Java..Here,I have followed a client-server architecture.
<br>
I have used Angular for frontend as a client and Java for backend as server...
<h3>Working:</h3>
Here,the user have to put the email(to whom user wants to send the email),subject and the message and it will send the email accordingly.
<br>
If there is an error while sending the email,then it will show failure..If the user also want to send some attachment along with the message,he can also do that.
<h3>Dependencies:</h3>
Used javax.mail dependency in pom.xml file..
